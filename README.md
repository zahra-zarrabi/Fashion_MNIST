# Fashion MNIST Classifier
We proposed a CNN network for Fashion Mnist classification. We used framework pytorch==1.8.2.
## Dataset
Fashion MNIST image dataset includes a training set of 60,000 samples and a test set of 10,000 samples. Each sample is a 28x28 image on a gray scale associated with a tag of 10 classes.

## Train
To train the model, please run fallowing:
```
python3 
```

```
python inference.py --device cpu --image 2.jpeg
```
